# DevOpsLab: On-Prem DevOps Project

A complete end-to-end **DevOps simulation project for on-prem environments**, including manual deployment, Dockerization, CI/CD with Jenkins, Kubernetes deployment using Minikube, and more.

---

## üì¶ Project Overview

A lightweight internal Issue Tracker API built using:

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **DevOps Tools**: Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes (Minikube), Git
- **Environment**: Ubuntu VM (Oracle VirtualBox)
- **Deployment Target**: On-prem simulation (local Linux VMs)

---

## üß± Phase 1: Manual FastAPI Deployment on Ubuntu VM

- Installed Python, FastAPI, and Uvicorn on Ubuntu
- Created a `main.py` FastAPI app with simple routes
- Exposed app on port 8000 and tested manually with `curl` and browser
- Configured `ufw` firewall to allow access
- Practiced Linux commands: `systemctl`, `top`, `ps`, `curl`, `journalctl`

---

## üê≥ Phase 2: Dockerize FastAPI App

- Created `Dockerfile` to containerize FastAPI app
- Built Docker image locally: `docker build -t fastapi-devopslab .`
- Ran container: `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 fastapi-devopslab`
- Added `.dockerignore` and `requirements.txt`
- Verified app was accessible via container

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 3: CI/CD with Jenkins (On-Prem)

- Installed Jenkins on the Ubuntu VM
- Configured Jenkins to run Docker builds
- Added a `Jenkinsfile` to the repo with the following stages:
  - Clone repository from GitHub
  - Build Docker image
  - Remove old container (if running)
  - Run new container
- Created a **Pipeline Job** in Jenkins to automate the full process

---

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Phase 4: Kubernetes Deployment (Minikube)

- Installed Minikube and `kubectl` on Ubuntu
- Created `deployment.yaml` to define app deployment
- Created `service.yaml` to expose app via NodePort (30080)
- Built Docker image inside Minikube environment
- Applied manifests using `kubectl apply -f`
- Accessed app via: `http://<minikube-ip>:30080/`
